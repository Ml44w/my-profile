				  	<h2>Dance</h2>
				  	<p>First of all, I wanted to talk about my passion for dance. I've been dancing since I was 3 years old and I've gone through all styles of dance, from classical to Hip Hop to modern jazz. I like to discover new styles and new dancers to inspire me in my creations. It's a real way for me to express my emotions.

				  	<h2>Guitar</h2>
				  	<p>I also wanted to talk about the guitar. I started when I was 8 years old. I am absolutely a music fan, if I am asked what to take to a desert island it would be my acoustic guitar first. I love this instrument that allows me to externalize my emotions whatever they are. I also play electric guitar since a few years.

				  	<h2>Singing</h2>
				  	<p>In addition to the guitar. I had to talk about the singing. Since I was a little girl I've been singing all the time, I like all styles but have a preference for Lana Delrey and Radiohead covers. Singing is a part of me, besides the covers I also compose some songs. Besides, I love to go to concerts to see the artists on stage, it helps me to better understand their musical universe.

				<div class="card-white">
				  	<h2>Cooking</h2>
				  	<p>Finally I wanted to talk about my passion for cooking. Until I was 15 years old I had a preference for pastry, now I prefer to cook savory and especially Asian cuisine. Beyond the fact of working the flavors. I like to cook and share my dishes with my friends and family, I like to please them through cooking.
